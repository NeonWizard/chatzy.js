# chatzy.js
chatzy.js is a NodeJS package for interfacing with the Chatzy API, alongside some extra functionality.

This library aims to objectify Chatzy features in a way idiomatic to NodeJS. This includes interfacing with the regular Chatzy client, as well as interfacing with Chatzy's chat with event emission and listeners inspired by the design of [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).

## Installing
```
npm install chatzy.js
```

## Example usage
```js
const { Client, Room } = require('../src')
const client = new Client()

client.on('ready', async () => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.email}!`)
  await client.joinRoom(63978621038107, { nickname: 'Deiga', color: 'FF3333' })
})

client.on('message', async message => {
  if (message.content === 'ping') message.room.send('pong')
})

client.login(process.env.EMAIL, process.env.PASSWORD).catch(console.error)
```
